# UCSDGraphs

A route discovery application project that was completed in [Coursera - UCSD Advanced Data Structures in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-structures/home/info) course.
Starter code, including GUI code, authored by the course instructors. 

## Overview
The app can discover and visualize routes from one point to another on a map.
The map is represented by a Graph and route discovery is done by BFS, Dijkstra or A* algorithms based on the user's preference.

## Get started
To start the application, run MapApp.java file under 'application' package.
